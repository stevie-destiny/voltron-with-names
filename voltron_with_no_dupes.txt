// Aurvandil FR6
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh this is a spicy roll. Reconstruction and chill clip are so strong together. Subsistence is another good shout if you know you’ll secure the kill. I think dropping the charge time as a quality of life perk will make the whole experience better, but if you are okay with the charge time normally, you can go for a larger magazine."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "In PvP there aren't a lot of pros for high-impact fusions. They are certainly strong and they are my favorites to use. But the charge time increase really hurt their overall utility. The change to 5 bolts was nice, but not having high-impact reserves in this weapons perk pool is a bit of a let down. Elemental capacitor can make it feel super consistent on void, arc or stasis. Firmly planted will make the shot you do take incredibly consistent, void or not." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Rapid-fire scouts are like the precision frame hand cannons. Decent but outclassed by most weapons.

Hammer-forged for range or smallbore for some stability. Scouts generally don’t need range but it also doesn’t hurt to maintain your aim assist at those longer engagements.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage.

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won’t need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play.

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Taking that fantastic base and transitioning it over to the crucible is easy. Most of the weapon stays the same. Arrowhead and rapid hit are the foundation. Steady rounds for more stability, or accurized rounds for even more range is your preference. In the last column you have three separate ways you can go. Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won’t need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play. Desperado is great for kill chaining in 6v6 but I wouldn’t use it in 3v3." Recommended MW - Range or Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue.

Their recent change to a fixed spread will help but their poor ammo economy on top of the gamemodes 1 shot per brick leads to a bad taste. They can be strong when barrel stuffing your opponent, but any shotgun will do then. I would just stay away from rapid-fire shotguns until there is a really strong incentive to use them."

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Unfortunately for Prolonged Engagement it won’t see a lot of use outside of PvE. Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

It has some of the lowest base stats within its archetypes but some of the most unique perks that can put it well above the rest. For one, it is the only rapid-fire frame to roll rangefinder. Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

Fluted barrel or hammer-forged rifling are your best options for barrels. Accurized is the only choice as for whatever reason Gunnora’s Axe doesn’t get access to assault mag. Threat detector and opening shot are the S tier combo to get. Iron reach and moving target are decent substitutes as long as you have the handling to back it up."

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front’s poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Cold Front has a giant hill to climb and with a lot of competition it might not be worth it. [...] Cold Front does have the best sights IMO so for me it’s semi-worth. In PvP you’re really looking for consistency or lethality. Cold Front does not have super strong lethality perks like kill clip or multikill clip, so you’re looking for consistency. Cold Front does offer rangefinder, putting it on par with its siblings, but the lack of stats still leaves a lot to be desired." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Its base stats aren’t anything to write home about. [...] Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you’re in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you’re fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. Over on MnK I would recommend killing wind for the bump in range, handling and movement speed.

Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible.

With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS."

If you're having trouble controlling the recoil, Heating Up will help correct the recoil direction on kills, and then match this with your choice of the range of damage output-increasing traits.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake.

Has decent stats compared to kinetic Lightweights. Sort out the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. To maximise damage against shields, look for Armor-Piercing Rounds and, in the absence of a complementary column 1 trait, Thresh provides a nice little boost to super regeneration.

title:WarlockMaggie's Season 19, Dawning Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller
Cold Front,Stats for All,One for All,Cold Front,Smallbore,Tactical Mag


// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Similar to my PvP recommendation, stability needs to be your priority but you can mix in range to get a bit more accuracy. Steady Rounds plus a Range MW provides that mix with a little extra Airborne Effectiveness to help you get the jump on your opponents. Combine that with a tried and true consistency combo of Tap the Trigger and Rangefinder, this will work for you if you put in the work of finding this roll. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
Cold Front,Tap the Trigger,Rangefinder,Cold Front,Smallbore,Steady Rounds


// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Stay Frosty,Well-Rounded,Headstone,Stay Frosty,Arrowhead Brake,Ricochet Rounds


// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Encore got a rework this season and it works well with Desperado as any missed precision final blows will still increase the range, stability and accuracy of the weapon (5, 8, and 1.25% / stack, up to 4 stacks). With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist. Either way, the lightweight frame will additionally give you a little boost in movement speed which may help you take cover from that Chaos Reach that just showed up. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Nothing beats the holiday whimsy of disintegrating your enemies in a void-powered explosion, getting a round auto-loaded, and then doing it all over again :) Glacioclasm hits hard, but it also handles like a brick. Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel. A Reload MW and the Omolon intrinsic trait will help make the rare time you need to reload not take an ice age. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Glacioclasm,Subsistence,Reservoir Burst,Glacioclasm,Fluted Barrel,Particle Repeater


// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I’m not going to dissuade anyone from taking this into the Crucible, but bear in mind that pre-charging your shot is crucial to success with this archetype. Due to your starting ammo count of 2, Under Pressure and HIR will be already online, giving you a little extra stats and punch to dissolve that charging Guardian holding a Wastelander… Recommended MW: Charge Time|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent. Avalanche takes Arrowhead quite nicely (70 to 100 recoil direction) and Ricochet rounds are my personal go-to for the range and stability bonuses it provides. Give it a try and you’ll see why it is my personal favorite LMG. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Avalanche,Subsistence,Incandescent,Avalanche,Arrowhead Brake,Ricochet Rounds


// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Adaptives are my favorite LMG archetype and this extends to use within Crucible. With a requirement of 5 crits to achieve the coveted .53s TTK, accuracy is going to be vital: enter DSR + Tap the Trigger. With DSR taking 0.6 seconds to fully ramp up, you will likely be near maximum benefit by that 5th shot. Like Hammerhead and other 450 rpm LMGs after it, this can catch many a Guardian by surprise and melt them quickly! Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
Avalanche,Dynamic Sway Reduction,Tap the Trigger,Avalanche,Hammer-Forged Rifling,Ricochet Rounds


// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Cold Steel is what sets this blade apert from every other, the slow-into-freeze ability is an amazing pairing with Stasis subclasses as well as good utility for mods and effects that care about Stasis/Slow application. Couple it with Duelist’s Trance for extra stats. It’s a chilling prospect to consider… Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Zephyr,Duelist's Trance,Cold Steel,Zephyr,Jagged Edge,Swordmaster's Guard


// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Okay, hear me out on this combo. It’s a unique one to the Adaptive frame sword archetype and what it allows is the ability to steal the overshield of a supering Guardian and apply it to yourself while dealing increased damage. This could mean you can easily shut down roaming, ground-based supers and survive the opposing team’s retribution. Otherwise, it’s just like any other sword in the Crucible (that doesn’t have Eager Edge). Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Smallbore and Flared are both going to provide minor buffs to stability which will be felt massively on a gun with a base of 7. Plus a little extra reload to help Frenzy along is never a bad thing, so Flared is a no brainer for me. Frenzy is fairly obvious, damage boost + reload boost baked into the same perk is really nice. Unrelenting may not be everyone's first pick, but for me, this gun feels like a mobbing monster, getting healing inside that same role is just a cherry on top. MW Unimportant|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Cold Front,Unrelenting,Frenzy,Cold Front,Smallbore,Flared Magwell


// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): While the main traits are obvious picks as far as this weapon is concerned, the rest is a little confusing. With a base 7 stability, will full sending into the stat actually make a meaningful difference? Will losing it entirely via Full Bore make a difference? I honestly don't know. I will be looking for these rolls because they're a great middle ground with a little extra stability for controllers. I do believe the rolls are interchangeable though, since it's just a MW difference. Recommended MW: Range (M+KB), Stability (Controller)|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
Cold Front,Tap the Trigger,Rangefinder,Cold Front,Smallbore,Accurized Rounds


// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Stay Frosty,Thresh,Headstone,Stay Frosty,Arrowhead Brake,Flared Magwell


// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Lightweight pulses are feeling a lot better in PvP these days and for me, Killing Wind and Kill Clip are perks that perfectly compliment each other and provide so many benefits to the gun it becomes a no brainer. With 55 Recoil Direction, Arrowhead Brake is a must on Stay Frosty and High-Caliber should assist in opening duels to get KW/KC rolling. Omolon Fluid Dynamics will make up for any stability or reload speed losses meaning you can get the extra little bit of range from the MW. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
Stay Frosty,Killing Wind,Kill Clip,Stay Frosty,Arrowhead Brake,High-Caliber Rounds


// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This roll feels fairly obvious. Kill stuff, Res Burst explodes them, Subsistence fills your mag and Res Burst is ready again. It's just good fun times and I didnt get it last year. The bonus damage from Res Burst will make up for the loss of impact from the Accelerated Coils and Charge Time MW. Recommended MW: Charge Time|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Glacioclasm,Subsistence,Reservoir Burst,Glacioclasm,Arrowhead Brake,Accelerated Coils


// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): This weapon is a High-Impact. You can try to skirt that fact with lower charge times, but it will still charge slow and hit hard as long as you're accurate. I say embrace it and full send into consistency. Corrected recoil direction, higher stability, better accuracy while under fire. Which you inevitably will be with a High-Impact. Unlike PvE, I don't feel the attempt at lowering charge time is worth it. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller
Avalanche,Subsistence,Incandescent,Avalanche,Arrowhead Brake,Flared Magwell


// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This one is tricky. I wanted to look for Thresh and Chain Reaction, but Half Truths can get that same roll and it would be enhanced via crafting. So it's necessary to commit to the thing only this sword can do, and that's Cold Steel. I figured Cold Steel and Wellspring would be a nice combo for any hyper aggressive Stasis builds.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I got nothing.

Maybe? In any case, Cold Steel is doing nothing for you in PvP, which is the only thing that makes this sword unique. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

You want to go all in to the magazine size, so use Extended Barrel and Backup Mag to get to five in the mag. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by up to three on reload or Triple Tap gets you seven crit shots without reloading.

Planck's doesn't really have that outside of Grave Robber, which means using an LMG for CQC engagements to get the most out of its perk pool. I can see it working with ranged melees, like with Warlock's Celestial Fire - a synergistic Karnstein, Grave Robber / Pugilist build could be fun. Ultimately, there's a few interesting options here for build-crafters, but not a lot to help it win out against better LMGs." tags:pve|tags:pve

You'll know which people have actually used the gun by the recommendations / rolls they're chasing. The base recoil direction and stability combo is bad. It kicks, 50RD is inconsistent at best, and sabotaging your play at worst. But -- if you get Heating Up, it completely fixes this, and allows you to make use of the utterly fantastic fourth column perks without reprieve. Heating Up / Golden Tricorn is my number 1, followed by Slideways, then more traditional options like Outlaw / Rampage, etc. If you're not running Heating Up, then definitely go for Arrowhead Brake and even consider running Counterbalance Stock here.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Stability] "Brigand's Law is fantastic. The Blunderbuss styling on a pocket-sized sidearm, the perk package including Threat Detector or Hip-Fire Grip, Enhanced Surrounded Spec going up to a 47% damage buff, then Voltshot which is simply phenomenal on this weapon type. Always invest MASSIVELY into Stability on Sidearms - Range quite simply does not matter for damage falloff. Is it Forbearance, or Trinity Ghoul? No. But hopefully, if we move back to a world where Primary weapons matter again, this is definitely in my backpack and ready for action." tags:pve|tags:pve

// Qullim's Terminus - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Blood Feud is slowly replacing my favourite SMG, Extraordinary Rendition. The new Ambitious Assassin buff is extremely good on this archetype, coupled with S-Tier SMG perk Frenzy. You can get comparable to Threat Detector speeds with a near-constant 15% damage buff, and going beyond double your mag size just by snowballing kills. When you set this thing up the right way, it plays fantastically well. Truly its only downside, from personal preference, comes from poor shading - for me, it doesn't win out on style points.

// Qullim's Terminus (Harrowed) - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Smite of Merain is a great-feeling Pulse with a stellar perk pool. For PvE, you're looking for consistent damage uptime, high Handling (always important for Champion content), and ways to bolster your abilities. Smite does all of this quite well. I'd be looking at Demo/Gutshot for high-level (Vorpal if Anti-Barrier Pulse is a thing), Demo/Adrenaline for low-level content, and Firefly just for the fun factor. Stats for All / One for All IS good, I just tend not to recommend it on Primary weapons that typically deal with one target at a time, unlike Heavies sporting the ability to really snowball kills." tags:pve|tags:pve

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For duelling, you don't really need to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger which together add stability and accuracy through your volley. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b).

// Wastelander M5 (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Assault Mag, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

This is a precision pellet (not slug) shotgun with decent baseline stats, but the subfamily is weaker than lightweights, still needing 11 out of 12 pellets to hit for a guaranteed kill, but with a slower fire rate. Barrel Shroud improves the handling, or Full Choke keeps the pellets a little tighter, Accurized Rounds and Opening Shot together boost range to 100 for a 7m damage falloff distance, and in the first trait column either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion passively boost handling. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. For direct, one-hit kills, you'll need Spike Grenades, paired with a barrel that boosts velocity. In the first trait column, Auto-Loading Holster means you can carry on about your business and have a shot ready when you need it, or Steady Hands provide a boost to handling when you swap back to your primary. In the second trait column Demolitionist or Pugilist grant a hefty 20% ability energy on a kill.

// Retraced Path (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Tactical Battery, (Well-Rounded, Perpetual Motion), Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly with a solar subclass. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Golden Tricorn x1 or Radiant get you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies, and if you can get Golden Tricorn x2 up (and have enough battery charge left), you can get an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.53s with 5 crits and 4 bodies. Choose a barrel that doesn't have any penalties and Tactical Battery provides a range of small gunfeel stat boosts. In the first trait column, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion both help further with gunfeel stats and, in the second, Golden Tricorn is the best damage boost for PvP. This could be very good with a Hunter Caliban's Hand build...

description:Reprised King's Fall weapons with Runneth Over origin trait

// Doom of Chelchis (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable.  First-choice PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload (at 180 RPM) and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

You can eke out a little more range, but you'll never match the Palindrome, unfortunately so you might be better off looking for a little extra stability to make hitting headshots a bit more consistent.

// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), (Heating Up, Killing Wind), (Golden Tricorn, Kill Clip, Swashbuckler, Adrenaline Junkie, Harmony)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. Backup PvP pick for duelling. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. For a kill-chaining roll, Heating Up or Killing Wind will help with follow-up kills. If you can keep the action in the top half of the magazine, the Omolon origin trait should help keep everything on target. One stack of any damage perk will then get you to the 0.6s TTK. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Roads, Rapid Hit, Box Breathing
//notes:First choice PvP roll for duelling. Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK) and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit in the first trait column helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost) Recommended MW: Handling, with a Full Auto Retrofit mod, Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duelling, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane).

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

// Pure Poetry
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you do not play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options. Rapid hit makes it easier to land consecutive crits, clown cartridge will overflow your magazine, and if you can remember to crouch field prep will be your best option for reserves and a fast reload.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

Look for other damage increasing perks like swash or AJ.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Bow Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.  Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Sprint Grip, Quick Access Sling, Freehand Grip (or Icarus Grip if you're serious about aerial use) mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Elemental Capacitor
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for duelling, to tuck away just in case, you might as well add to range with barrel and mag, and then make it more controllable with Dynamic Sway Reduction and Elemental Capacitor with a Void subclass.

Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Excellent first-choice slug-shottie, particularly for Stasis subclasses who can use an Aspect to create Stasis shards, and Fragments to use those to regain melee and grenade energy or for Damage Reduction. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first trait column, and  Headstone gives you all the stasis good stuff in the second and, as a bonus in Comp or Trials, prevents revives while the crystal persists.

First choice for a slug-shottie, and the perks can make this into a kill-chaining monster if you can find the ammo. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first train column, and then a fully-procced Swashbuckler or Enhanced Surrounded (when Bungie rolls the boost from the mod into the perk) in the second column brings the damage up to one-shot body levels.

// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (Ionised Battery, Enhanced Battery), Field Prep, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Any Battery with Backup Mag pushes you up to eight shots in the battery, so why not take advantage of a shorter charge time from Accelerated Coils? Further build into the faster charge time with Cornered, add ammo reserves and faster reloads with Field Prep, or trigger health regeneration on kills with Unrelenting in the first trait column.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for melee builds in general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. High-ish stats make this fairly competitive in slot (if you don't look too closely at Heritage, anyway). You can never go wrong with a bit more range from your barrel, and faster fire rate, or an extra round in the mag and better reload speed. You can turn this into a great melee support option with Pugilist and Wellspring (for ability regen) or Swashbuckler (for damage output).

Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing.

Unfortunately it is the true master of one.

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both.

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lunulata-4b is a great alternative in the kinetic slot. The clear choice is to pair it with any of the stasis builds, and you’d be absolutely correct. Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Adaptive auto-rifles are still pretty competitive as at S17 v4.1.5.2.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for aggressive duelling. Arguably the one of the best PvP hand-cannons as at S17, if you're not mainly in the air, anyway - almost feels like you have an additional perk boost in the base stats, and has the highest base stability of any legendary HC. Boost Handling and Stability with our sight and mag. Perpetual Motion boosts those stats even further, just by moving around, and pair this with a Harmony Shotgun, like Matador 64, for your highly aggressive playstyle swapping between primary and special, each boosting the other's damage after kills.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Not available as at S17 unfortunately, but arguably the strongest legendary PvP SMG in the game. Strong stats - almost auto-rifle range is possible. Push out the range as far as you can, even to the detriment of stability with barrel, mag and masterwork - this is a precision frame with 95 recoil direction, so it fires straight up and down, and a 16 zoom scope helps constrain bullet spread when ADS. Killing Wind adds a host of boosts including more range or Tunnel Vision adds bonus Aim Assist after a kill, at which point Kill Clip reduces both optimal and body shot TTK by 25%. Masterwork: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-chain, controller, mkb

Push out the range as far as you can with barrel, mag and Masterwork - this is a precision frame with 95 recoil direction, so it fires straight up and down, and a 16 zoom scope helps constrain bullet spread when ADS. The combination of Tap the Trigger on initial trigger pull and Dynamic Sway Reduction as you keep firing should make it easy to land shots consistently. Masterwork: Range, with an Adept Range mod to push range out to 100, a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Adept Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-god pvp-duel, controller

//notes: (???  ???): Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 20. PvE first-choice roll for end-game add-clear. Unfortunately, you'll get no use from the Iron Banner-based origin trait, and the perks are a bit PvP orientated. Arrowhead Brake gets your recoil direction vertical, and Accelerated Coils helps with the charge time (you should still have enough damage to get a kill though), Particle Repeater helps tighten the spread or Ionized/Enhanced Battery gives more shots. Subsistence bypasses the Reload Speed penalty from Ionised Battery, and keeps you shooting until you run out of ammo, and Successful Warm-up reduces charge time without reducing damage so you can rip through beefier adds and majors.

Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip mod, to double down on hip-fire, or an Icarus Grip mod gets the Airborne Effectiveness to 31, which makes Firefright a jack of all trades - usable in the air, as well as at mid-range while ADS or closer up while hip-firing.|tags:pvp

// Redback-5si
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Sidearms in PvE are in a weird spot, while they have high damage per shot and excel in close range, you don’t always want to put yourself into those situations. The best perk for the Redback-5si is surrounded with surrounded spec, but that is a hairy situation to begin with. I would bump up its mag, range, and spec into reloader perks to maximize this sidearm’s usage, but I just don’t think it beats submachine guns, let alone autos or other longer ranged primaries."

// Redback-5si
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "While I love this archetype for PvP, I just cannot bring myself to like Redback-5si. Veist weapons feel good, I enjoy the archetype. But something about this sidearm just doesn’t feel right. It could be the lack of power behind its shots, hit registration being wonky, or just the sound not sitting well with me. But ultimately Redback-5si is an alright sidearm. Not having high-lethality perks is a downer, but I can get past that with better neutral perks. You want to push out its range without sacrificing other stats to try and edge yourself into submachine gun territory to find the best success." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Snorri-FR5
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Compulsive reloader has its best use when paired with reservoir burst to maximize uptime on that larger damage. Couple that with last season’s particle deconstruction and chefs kiss. Unfortunately we can only work with the seasonal mods we have now, so Snorri-FR5 falls off considerably, but still has great utility in double special weapons builds as the primary form of add-clear. Pair this with another special weapon that does good single target damage and you have yourself a build (heavy weapon optional)." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Reckless Endangerment
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvE there are just better shotguns, where a neutral, high-handling weapon just will not fit the bill. In Reckless Endangerment’s benefit is how smooth it feels to use. No other shotgun really comes close to how fluid this feels without any investment. [...] Crucible is where Reckless Endangerment can really flex [...] Having a shotgun that you don’t really have to invest in to make it feel fluid gives new players and people uncomfortable with PvP a shotgun to compete with. The obvious comparison is Riiswalker and I do think Riiswalker takes the cake over Reckless Endangerment in all forms of PvP. That being said, you can use Reckless Endangerment and hang with Riiswalker without feeling like a detriment to your team or yourself.". Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,pvp,mkb,controller

// Duty Bound
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "With triple tap, fourth time’s the charm, and actium war rig, you could fire forever. In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release. Ideally you want to bring up the recoil direction from the base 60, but chambered compensator or extended barrel won’t do as much, and you won’t want to slot a counterbalance mod in favor of any of the spec mods. Arrowhead then becomes the only choice to really improve that recoil to something more desirable. Other options are then just to make the gun feel better. Stats for all pairs really well with one for all, but also fourth time’s the charm or vorpal for a better feeling gun. And perpetual motion will elevate the gun feel without needing to shoot.".

That being said, it doesn’t immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father’s Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard’s Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

/ Any barrel, (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Shoot to Loot, (Headstone, Explosive Rounds, Focused Fury, One for All, Vorpal Weapon)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 11. PvE first choice roll for end-game content. Choose your barrel depending on your Stability/Handling/Recoil Direction preferences. A mag that provides reload speed, or a bit of extra ammo is useful for uptime in a fight. Shoot to Loot can be very useful for end-game content allowing you to restock ammo from cover and reload all your weapons. Headstone works well with Stasis builds and the origin perk, which does additional damage to stasis crystals for the dragonfly-like AOE damage, Explosive Payload adds damage, flinch and utility against Champions, or non-kill damage boosters increase your effectiveness in combat. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Handling, with Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major, or Taken Spec) mod.|tags:pve

Volatile Launch or Confined Launch keep the velocity down, which is good in an auto-tracking launcher, and Impact Casing ups damage slightly. For Boss DPS, Auto-Loading Holster is the best option, with Explosive Light (but not the enhanced version which adds velocity) the best if you're in a fireteam and generating orbs, and for Champions with an instant detonation. If you're looking for straight boss damage, or soloing, Lasting Impression is easier to use. Recommended MW: Blast Radius or Handling, with damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod.|tags:pve

With Overload ARs (and a rework) looming, a 20% Vorpal buff for primaries, some great perk options, easy farming options, and 720s generally shredding for CQC, I can foresee Arctic Haze being very viable (or at the least, very fun).

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Ancient Gospel can be fantastic - just its base stat package isn't great versus other options in-slot. If all the stars align, and you can nail down Accurized, Range masterwork, and a Range-oriented barrel, you're onto a very unique, very strong competitor. The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots.

Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "BrayTech Werewolf is a great gun. 450RPMs have been given a better shot for a while now, and this one has a number of perk options that allow it to make up for the archetype's shortcomings.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "PLUG ONE has a large variety of perk playstyles that make it a little difficult to find a direction to go in. In general, you want high Stability (over Range, Stab = bolt spread), a lower Charge Time (tied to damage, so if you're not consistently one-shotting, you may need more) and either something that'll give you a constant helping hand (Under Pressure), or allow you to chain kills more easily (Heating Up). Backup Plan is great for a high-Handling build, and Kickstart for sniping as you enter into lanes. What works for you may be different to what works for others, so its worth trying out a few options." tags:pvp

Pellet shotties got a 10% PvE buff at the tail-end of Season 15, and it does feel noticeable in practice, especially when spraying down yellow bars or Fallen Walkers with shot-after-shot-after-shot from a Rapid-Fire Frame. Threat Detector is an S-Tier choice. Surrounded is made for this weapon. Vorpal is a great backup. Trench Barrel comes in at +50% - if you can remember to melee-stompcancel, you will chew through that enemy. Also: Warmind Cells. Run Fireteam Medic and you become unstoppable." tags:god-pve

It's got 12 in each column and comes from Gambit, so most people automatically write off being able to acquire a well-rolled one. Heating Up/Kill Clip is my preferred roll, as Heating Up allows you to negate its horrible recoil direction and run something that isn't Arrowhead. Rapid Hit falls closely behind for hitting successive shots. It's a great feeling gun if you're willing to put the work in." tags:pvp

Typically, you'll want (Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado) or (Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip). There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here.

Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu.

Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker.

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves (Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage), you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:god-pve

Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon. Very strong contender should Heavy GLs get some time in the limelight again." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Stability] [Use Counterbalance Stock if you don't have Arrowhead Brake] "The BR may be the best-feeling gun I've ever experienced in Destiny. It's incredibly consistent, performs way outside of its expected range bracket, encourages playing off-angles and surprise plays, and can effectively counter shotgun-rushers in the mid-to-above-average-skill level. Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights. For sixes, if you're a better player, Kill Clip instead of Elemental will make you unstoppable. Is the BR a meta-defining weapon? No. Is it viable? Yes. Is it fun as hell? Oh my god, yes." tags:god-pvp

Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off.

// The Hothead - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

// Hung Jury SR4 - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:god-pve

The trade-off in-game is not as appealing as on paper. That being said, if you're investing heavily in Stability to offset it, it could be very nice to get the incremental range bump." tags:pvp

Snapshot/Opening Shot is the usual god-roll, though there's some interesting interactions with Frenzy / Adrenaline Junkie (in a separate col. to Snapshot) that allows for 1-shot body shots (setup-dependent). Firmly Planted also has a strong following, so its safe to say we'll see some of these floating around when the Adepts become available." tags:god-pvp

// Fel Taradiddle - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Accuracy with Elastic] "Fel Taradiddle is a great-feeling Bow to directly compete with Whispering Slab. As a Craftable, you can fine-tune it to be as strong as possible, which I believe to be (Elastic String, Compact for Reload or Straight Fletching for Accuracy, with an Accuracy MW). You have access to Archer's, Perpetual and Killing Wind depending on playstyle, and Explosive/Successful and Adrenaline Junkie. Whereas I believe Whispering Slab's Swashbuckler to be a stronger perk for Bows (with AJ having more grenade synergy on Energy weapons), the damage perk does not go unnoticed. Fel feels great, and it's definitely worth having one in your back pocket." tags:pve

// Forensic Nightmare - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Forensic Nightmare feels great, looks great, and has some stellar perk options. It's primary issue, however, lies in its 13 Zoom stat, which effectively castrates the gun. With a (base) max damage falloff of 15m, comparing to Shayura's 17 Zoom, 21.3m damage falloff... It's incredibly noticeable. There's some issues with muzzle flash here in darker areas too. Ultimately, I'd rely on the great perks Forensic has access to, and use it more casually. A shame that the Zoom stat neuters this gun, as even the Friction Fire has 16 for the exact same frame." tags:pve

If you're crouch/slide averse -- Perpetual or Heating Up are strong options here too. There's a careful balancing act for PvP Charge Time I won't get into (look up Castle Content for a full breakdown), but for PvE I wanted pure consistency at a distance outside of Rapid Fire's normal operating range, so Smallbore + Particle Repeater were my go-to's." tags:pve

Consistency is king here, and its important to note the fine-tuning will feel different on console vs. PC (invest into more Recoil Direction on Console, whereas PC can offset this somewhat by investing further into Stability).

A little cooler is Grave Robber's synergy on Glaives, with the Glaive melee fully reloading the magazine and nullifying any need to invest in reload perks. Swashbuckler currently only boosts the projectile damage, but the projectiles are a larger part of the Glaive identity we haven't fully realised yet.

// Red Herring - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload] "Red Herring's main niche is access to Enhanced Field Prep for maximised reserves, though doesn't necessarily win out against the multitude of rockets we have for either burst, combo, or sustained damage. It's good if you need a void rocket, and synergises with Volatile Rounds. Not a huge amount to write home about unfortunately." tags:pve

Great stats, great recoil direction, the classic "Recluse"-style Veist frame, with the new Veist Origin Trait that randomly refills the mag mid-stream, Subsistence that refunds the mag on kills, and damage perks that can maintain near-constant uptime (Frenzy / Adrenaline). It comes at a perfect time, combining Void typing with Void 3.0's Volatile Rounds. There will be a good amount of people who pick this thing up, and then never put it back down.

Snapshot/Opening Shot is the usual god-roll, though there's some interesting interactions with Frenzy / Adrenaline Junkie (in a separate col. to Snapshot) that allows for 1-shot body shots (setup-dependent). Firmly Planted also has a strong following, so its safe to say we'll see some of these floating around when the Adepts become available." tags:god-pvp

// Insidious - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Stab / Handling] "Insidious is the perfect candidate for Crafting - a very rich perk pool with some great potential synergy, but with the need to fine-tune some things like Handling/Reload Speed depending on your perk choices. A PvE Insidious can have a one-of-a-kind (non-sunset) combo in Dragonfly/Rampage, though you're no longer benefitting from something like Rapid Hit / Heating Up, which are usually fixing your reload/recoil direction issues. Vorpal shreds Supers on this archetype, Demo/Adrenaline still rocks, Rapid Hit is perfect for 4-burst Pulses (and you feel the stability change mid-burst too) - there's a lot to love here, you've just gotta get the stars to align." tags:pve

Auto-Loading Holster with Explosive Light is going to be your go-to for all your damage needs, unless for some reason you want to shoot all rockets consecutively, then you're after Impulse/Frenzy or Impulse/Explosive Light depending on orb usage (but likely another rocket altogether that actually rolls with Clown Cartridge).

Explosive Light is a top-tier option for orb-heavy engagements, though comes into effect less often than you'd think post-orb change. Adrenaline Junkie would be my workhorse recommendation here, until the day that Heavy Grenade Launchers see themselves as a viable DPS option again." tags:god-pve

As a Craftable, Enhanced Subsistence refunds up to +25% of the mag per kill, Enhanced Overflow gives an additional bonus from +5-20%, and then Frenzy elevates pretty much any SMG into god-tier status.

// Thoughtless - [YeezyGT's WQ] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Thoughtless is the secret DPS Sniper that we probably won't see properly utilised again until the next Raid race. With Enhanced Overflow, Extended Mag and Backup Mag, it maxes out at 17(!) in the mag, when paired with Font of Might, goes toe-to-toe with Izanagi's Burden. It's a bit more difficult to optimise swaps, but frees up the Exotic slot. Firing Line is the obvious option, though Focused Fury has a pretty low activation requirement, and allows you to use it solo / separate from teammates. That should come down to personal preference." tags:god-pve

// Explosive Personality - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Handling for ALH] "Explosive Personality is our new non-sunset Solar wave frame, sporting a bunch of decent perk options, and the benefits of being a Craftable weapon. Land Tank is a great Origin perk to have, especially for a wave frame where you are getting rapid kills in close proximity to the enemy. Unrelenting pairs naturally here, along with fast reloader perks like Threat Detector / Feeding Frenzy / Frenzy. There is currently an odd glitch (4 weeks into WQ) where this gun specifically does more self-damage, so can't be fully utilised shooting at your feet in the same way all other wave frames can." tags:pve

Firmly Planted (of course), Surplus as a reload booster, Heating Up for kill chaining, and the Omolon Origin trait that pairs fantastically with Reservoir Burst.

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Ragnhild has some fantastic Handling-based options, with access to E-Cap, Frenzy, Steady Hands and Perpetual Motion - the rule of thumb here is to get as close to 60 Range as you can (Ragnhild maxes out at 60) for consistency's sake. That unfortunately results in the loss of Full Choke / Assault Mag options, if you want to get the full bang-for-your-buck in the OHK department.

// (Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Extended Barrel, Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload 
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 2. PvE first choice roll for end game content. Rapid Hit more than offsets the Extended Barrel reload penalty, and Explosive Payload adds flinch and better anti-Overload Champion performance when that mod's in town.

// Arctic Haze - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Arctic Haze is heavily, heavily slept on. With Overload ARs (and a rework) looming, a 20% Vorpal buff for primaries, some great perk options, easy farming options, and 720s generally shredding for CQC, I can foresee Arctic Haze being very viable (or at the least, very fun). Dragonfly is fun. Unrelenting is amazing in PvE now. The Recoil Direction naturally sucks, but it had to be reigned in somewhere." tags:pve

// Ancient Gospel - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Ancient Gospel can be fantastic - just its base stat package isn't great versus other options in-slot. If all the stars align, and you can nail down Accurized, Range masterwork, and a Range-oriented barrel, you're onto a very unique, very strong competitor. The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

Dragonfly is never going to be boring. Outlaw is always great.

Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots.

Whispering Slab definitely has the "cool" factor of firing from a portable surfboard, and if you can snag a Vorpal roll, that will do decently well against Champions, Majors and the like.

There are so many viable rolls on this that your best bet is to just go out and try them - what works for you may be completely different to everyone else. If you want some guidance; Col. 2: [Ricochet for stats, High-Cal/Armor Piercing for flinch], Col. 3: [Rangefinder for Zoom, Perpetual for constant buffs, Rapid Hit for ensuring you win the fights you start], Col 4: [Headstone for Stasis, Kill Clip for slaying in sixes, Moving Target for Aim Assist].

It unfortunately suffers from the same affliction other 150RPMs have from being merged into the 140RPM category - where they were previously Lightweights with low Range, but instrinsic Mobility buffs, they are now Adaptives, with lower Range than all other Adaptives, and no Mobility buff to make up for it." tags:pve

Nailing down a decent roll of this isn't easy, with a whopping 12 perks in each column. Are Sidearms that viable in endgame?

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Outside of that, having Demolitionist in Col. 3 is a major boon - it allows this to be one of few guns that can run Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie, or just running Demo with damage perks like Frenzy in general. If you find a roll you like, stick with it. On Console, I might recommend investing into Stability a little further on this one - it kicks a bit compared to some more consistent 600RPMs." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "PLUG ONE has a large variety of perk playstyles that make it a little difficult to find a direction to go in. In general, you want high Stability (over Range, Stab = bolt spread), a lower Charge Time (tied to damage, so if you're not consistently one-shotting, you may need more) and either something that'll give you a constant helping hand (Under Pressure), or allow you to chain kills more easily (Heating Up). Backup Plan is great for a high-Handling build, and Kickstart for sniping as you enter into lanes.

You can do some decent numbers with One for All given the easy activation requirements for a weapon of this type, and Golden Tricorn is a pretty huge damage buff if that matches your playstyle. I really think Subsistence transforms this gun in a way that makes it necessary, though I'll include Perpetual here for the steady Reload + Stability buffs.

Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu. I think if 180s were given a chance to shine (outside of seasons where they're an Overload damage type), the IKELOS_HC would see some great success." tags:pve

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon.

// Praedyth's Revenge - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Praedyth's is the perfect burst DPS Sniper. With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves (Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage), you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:god-pve

// The Messenger - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance Stock] "Messenger is one of the most powerful Primaries in the game. It comes loaded with a stellar perk pool and strong stat package, with really two primary playstyles; Desperado or Kill Clip. Typically, you'll want (Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado) or (Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip). There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here. I usually find more success with Kill Clip, as I prefer maintaining a uniform RPM." tags:god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "The Multimach is a firm favourite of SMG aficionados in high-level PvP. While some farm for explicitly strict rolls, this recommendation has perks for those at different skill levels / platforms included. Typically, you'll want to maximise Range wherever possible, with Stability being crucial on Console, though not really a consideration on PC (opening up options like Iron Reach). Kill Clip is great if you are someone able to reliably chain kills, otherwise Iron Grip may suit you during the 900RPM adjustment period (huge Stability buff). Threat Detector comes down to personal preference - some players prefer a uniform handling experience, some appreciate the sudden buffs." tags:god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Shepherd's Watch main edge over Eye of Sol is a) Under Pressure, b) Accessibility - the average player will have been showered in Shepherd's Watches before ever thinking about playing a Trials match.

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

// Transfiguration - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] [Arrowhead/Counterbalance recommended] "One of the coolest looking Scouts in the game. It kicks like a mule, so you may want to invest in Stability a little more than usual. The Recoil Direction isn't perfect, but it fires so slowly that some may not mind it all that much. It comes with some pretty stellar perks, and can roll the ancient Rampage/Kill Clip combo. With Anti-Barrier Scout back on the menu, I'd hold onto one to breeze through longer-range engagements." tags:pve

// Sola's Scar (Adept) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Sola's is one of two Legendary Caster Frames, and the only one of the two that matters. Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker. Either way, Chain Reaction's fun, Frenzy's strong, Vorpal is a good backup." tags:pve

// Pardon Our Dust - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "This is the Grenade Launcher we've always wanted. A Kinetic slot GL that can roll with not only Auto-Loading (a first-ever), but Vorpal Weapon simultaneously. If you're a triple GL fan like me, it means you can now run a full suite of Auto-Loading GLs, rotate an ALH Pardon with a Demolitionist Salvo for Atheon damage, or just simply have access to more varied Blinding Grenade builds. Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH (which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code). Also comes with Ambitious Assassin, and Perpetual isn't bad either." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Reload] "It's got the super unique combo of Genesis/Shield Disorient, that seems to be dedicated to an encounter or Champion system that doesn't exist yet. In a world with a lot of Arc shields, or Anti-Barrier Shotgun, this would be king.

I've brought 390RPM Pulses into a few different GMs, and they always do fine.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The PvP player's "1K". Rocking the now-incredibly rare combo of Quickdraw/Snapshot, 1K is one of the most fluid-feeling Snipers in the game. The scope decals may require a small adjustment period, but the benefits of being able to invest primarily in Range (more aim assist at distance) over Handling feel like a great trade-off. This is a familiar-feeling Sniper, a great workhorse, and incredibly easy to farm for. Ticks all the boxes." tags:god-pvp

Killing Wind gives you a Diet Chaperone. Hip-Fire Grip is actually really strong here, and I've hit far more hip-fire headshots in the heat of the moment than you'd expect. Keep your Handling as high as possible - the range difference is fairly negligible from 80-100, we're talking about 1 metre of range (literally about 1 step in-game), and Handling is massively important." tags:god-pvp

Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

title:YeezyGT's S15 wishlist picks.

// Ignition Code - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve,god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "So, it took me 250 Overrides to collect the rolls I wanted for this, like Thanos with the Infinity Stones. Generally; [Quick/Hard Launch / Spike/Blinding / Surplush/Slideshot/Ambitious / Vorpal/Demolitionist/Frenzy]. Ultimately, this is a fantastic gun, and the rolls are mostly personal preference. There's a lot of fuss over Slideshot, but you may ultimately decide it doesn't fit your playstyle - my personal recommendation is Surplus, as it feels a lot better to get into the reload-shoot rhythm to me. Slideshot for PvP, however."|tags:god-pve,god-pvp

// Age-Old Bond - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability] "If you're seeing this, you got an Arrowhead Brake roll - the solution to the curse that plagues most 360RPMs - horrible recoil direction. This roll will have near-vertical recoil, though still expect it to kick like a mule. Zen Moment / Dynamic Sway / Tap the Trigger thankfully make up half the pool here, and massively help control it. With Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle being the only option for S15, I'd fully expect better players to move to 360RPMs as a Scout Rifle replacement, and Age-Old Bond has the perfect mix of range and controllable recoil to make that work."|tags:pve

// Scathelocke - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE) Scathelocke: (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability / Range] "Scathelocke returns from its sunsetting slumber with a clear goal in mind - fill the near-empty space where 600RPM Kinetic ARs should have been for the last 280 days. Now one of three in the slot, its direct competition are The Last Breath and The Forward Path (previously the only 600RPM in the slot). Both Scathelocke and The Last Breath suffer from "Year 1 Syndrome", being weapons that kick like a mule. Arrowhead Brake transforms the gun, giving it a better 90 recoil direction, and its new perk combinations rock -- you'll want Subsistence/Rampage to mow down waves of adds, something that was noticeably lacking from The Forward Path."|tags:pve

// Peacebond - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): [MW: Range / Stability] "This is the Sidearm that even Sidearm-haters love. A lot of great options here - Swashbuckler is always S-Tier on close-range weapons, and even without it you can easily shut down shotgunners both in and out of their operational range. The in-air accuracy (as a burst weapon) is also very competitive. You'll be surprised at the range you can clean up with this - even without Rangefinder. Pulse Monitor is a strong pick here, along with Killing Wind and Under Pressure (giving a helping hand when you're whiffing shots)."|tags:god-pvp

// Deafening Whisper - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "Martyr's Retribution's purple cousin. Currently the only usable Wave Frame Special Grenade Launcher, with a bit of a mixed perk pool. Surplus/Threat Detector make for great rapid-fire kill capabilities, turning handling/reload speed up to 11. Auto-Loading Holster is great as always. Rampage is a weird one on this, as the kill-recognition is still a bit bugged almost a year later. To be perfectly honest, almost any roll will work on this, none truly transform the gun away from its core functionality."|tags:pve

// Extraordinary Rendition - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE / PvP): (god-pve,god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE / PvP): [MW: Stability / Reload / Range] "A personal favourite. For PvE, invest in; [Stability / Reload / Subsistence/Overflow / Rampage/Frenzy]. For PvP, invest in; [Surplus / Multikill Clip]. After IKELOS_SMG, this is likely the best 750RPM - and it definitely sounds like it. Subsistence is insanely strong on SMGs post-Primary changes, and Frenzy gives the perfect reload buff that SMGs direly need in PvE. In PvP, this is a strong contender, and up there as one of the best Legendary options, after Multimach in the same slot."|tags:god-pve,god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability / Reload Speed] "There's a reason you see the IKELOS_SR-v1.0.2 in World's First Raids, low-man challenges and the like. While the efficacy of Warmind Cells are currently being called into question, the IKELOS_SR is just fine without them. 140RPMs sporting mag-refunders like Triple Tap/FTTC and High-Impact Reserves are always going to be fantastic burst damage, and its great to have a Disruption Break roll in your back pocket if we're ever blessed with Anti-Barrier Sniper again. For console players, investing in Stability / recoil direction is going to be slightly more important for consistent shots."|tags:god-pve

// Friction Fire - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Reload Speed / Stability] "If 600RPMs were to receive a PvE buff in future, Friction Fire would be a good weapon to have in your back pocket. Subsistence is incredibly strong post-Primary ammo changes, Threat Detector is always a top-tier pick for SMGs, and FF can roll with Rampage for easy ad clearance, Wellspring for ability boosting, and Vorpal if we're likely to see Anti-Barrier SMG again in future. It does struggle with Reload Speed, so invest in here, with the second priority being Stability, as this one's a bit bouncy."|tags:pve

// Vulpecula - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Reload / Range] "Vulpecula is a stellar 180. Not only does it deal the extra 5% vs. shields due to its Elemental typing, it maintains the full Kinetic damage coding. In short, it is 5% stronger than every other 180RPM in PvE, blow-for-blow. As for stats, the Reload is a tad sluggish - invest into it, or rely on an Outlaw roll. Explosive Payload is always an S-Tier option, though seems to break Outlaw's registration sometimes - Headstone works as a kind of Stasis-crystal Dragonfly, which just feels great. This is going to be incredibly strong if Overload Hand Cannon becomes a Champion option again in future.|tags:god-pve

// Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): "God, this thing is so good now. People haven't fully caught on. Post-Lightweight buff, the CQC is a fantastic dueling option, with a very small perk pool that lets you pull viable rolls fairly easily. Straight up, [Full Choke/Assault Mag/Slideshot or Quickdraw/Snapshot Sights] is probably your best PvP roll, with Full Choke + Snapshot completely transforming the gun's one-shot-kill potential, and Slideshot allowing for an effective range bump. Vorpal is also great, though you'll be unlikely to land the killing blow with a Lightweight shotgun these days."|tags:god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity / Reload Speed] "If you're looking for the best Rocket, you've found it. Don't worry too much about Impact Casing, which ultimately amounts to a 3% damage buff. You'll likely want a few Hezen's for different situations, Overflow/Lasting Impression is incredible for sustained DPS, ALH/Lasting or ALH/Vorpal for Champions, Demolitionist is always great as a secondary auto-reloader, too."|tags:god-pve

// Canis Major - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "Canis Major is the new king of 150RPMs. Whereas Impulse Amplifier was recently limited to just Memory Interdict (which has truly abysmal Velocity), it now being on Canis Major flat-out gives it the highest DPS potential for the slot. No other HGL comes within sniffing distance of this thing's max Velocity. And then they gave it Vorpal Weapon too. Best burst damage roll; [Hard Launch / Spike Grenades / Impulse Ampifier / Vorpal Weapon]. Its only drawback is the lack of an auto-loading option.

// Zealot's Reward - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability] "With the right rolls, the Zealot's Reward can unseat Null Composure -- if you need a [Void] Fusion Rifle for higher-level content. Null is a stat monster though - so your benefits come from being able to roll Liquid Coils, the Under Pressure/High Impact Reserves combo, or Shield Disorient/Disruption Break. The former is fantastic for sustained damage, the latter for area control. Unfortunately, the recoil direction on this will always be poor -- invest highly in Stability for your best chance at counteracting this ((Higher stability = tighter bolt spread - far more important than Range for Fusion Rifles))"|tags:pve

// Seventh Seraph SAW - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability / Range / Handling] "A personal favourite. While Warmind Cells' efficacy is currently being called into question, the SAW truly doesn't even need them. Auto-Loading Holster is a must for LMGs (sorry SWARM), and being able to roll Vorpal Weapon and Disruption Break makes SAW a top-tier pick for GMs. The recoil direction is horrible, but due to the slow firing speed, is easy to work around and plays into the power fantasy somewhat. The thing feels like you're firing a portable tank turret, and does the numbers (with a new 20% dmg buff) to back it up."|tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability / Reload Speed] "I'm unashamedly part of the Death Adder fan-club. While it shares a model with Recluse, its actually an entirely different SMG. Best used within its own Dragonfly niche, you'll want something to bolster its Reload Speed, or, if on console, address its (not great) Stability. Those come in the forms of Subsistence, Feeding Frenzy, and Dynamic Sway Reduction. Outside of those, fight your instincts and value Stability/Reload over Range -- I'd even consider Steady Rounds of all things. Great SMG, but it makes you work for its potential."|tags:pve

It's the only 390RPM Kinetic Pulse Rifle, so if you're a fan of Forge's Pledge / Last Perdition / Third Axiom - here's one for the Kinetic slot. Good feeling gun, puts in a lot of work in both modes, with some nice recoil and perks like Surplus/Quickdraw that help in general combat."|tags:pvp,pve

Four seasons later, with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle being the [only] AB mod, 360RPMs have the blend of range + damage potential that's needed for high-level content to occupy the space usually reserved for Scout Rifles. You're unlikely to need an additional Range bump - invest in Stability to allow for consistent shooting, and False Promises is blessed with a good stock recoil direction as-is. I feel as though Rampage isn't a huge help, given the slow time-to-kill on 360RPMs and short Rampage duration (3s), though would hold onto a roll anyway."|tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Handling / Stability] "This is a super-versatile perk pool, so you're bound to find something you like. As a burst damage option, if they ever buff Firing Line, Clown/Overflow + Firing Line is going to make this incredibly strong. For PvP, as a more-farmable Frozen Orbit (72RPM), Snapshot/Killing Wind are great, and Arrowhead Brake lets you get 100 vertical recoil. On Console, I'd recommend investing in Stability if you're planning on firing multiple times, if not, Handling is quite important, as it leans more towards the sluggish Succession-level of Handling."|tags:pve,pvp

The High-Caliber Rounds flinch makes a noticeable difference in a fight, and the time-to-kill when Kill Clip is up is really strong. Swashbuckler is also a strong option.

Lightweight Frames typically don't have much advantage over Precision Frames, given that there's a "limit" for how low you can get Draw Time, but this will still steer you right. Most perks will work on this, Swashbuckler is pretty great for range variation, Quickdraw/Opening Shot if you're just wanting a Champion stopper, and Frenzy is great if you're playing mid-range. Truthfully, this is more of a PvP Bow, but we'll take the slot fillers where we can."|tags:pve

// Wolftone Draw - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Draw Time / Reload Speed] "Wolftone Draw is special. Currently, its the only Precision Frame Bow that can roll with Impulse Amplifier, which massively speeds up your time between shots via projectile speed and reload time. There's a lot that works with this Bow, but it being able to sport Dragonfly with a higher damage-per-arrow really lets it leave Arsenic Bite behind. Treat this thing like a baby Trinity Ghoul, and it will do right by you. Some fantastic synergy with Archer's Tempo and Adagio too, which translates to being able to one-shot heavier PvE red-bars in most activities while maintaining a lightning-fast Draw Time. No Explosive Head on this one however, which is incredibly helpful for Overload Champions."|tags:pve

// Frozen Orbit - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvP): [MW: Handling] "This is probably the best-feeling Sniper in the game when it has high-Handling rolls. At 75 stock Recoil Direction, its near-vertical out of the gate. Arrowhead takes this to 100, more noticeable on Console. You have a lot of options with Frozen Orbit -- Surplus + Snapshot is stupidly fast. No Distractions + Opening Shot is a fan favourite for ensuring calculated headshots. Vorpal actually isn't needed, as you should one-shot headshot almost all Supers. High Impact Reserves if you're a body-shot bandit. The perk pool sounds like it would have been a great PvE option, but the mag size simply isn't there -- stick with Uzume."|tags:god-pvp

Scopes are mainly personal preference, so I've listed all the short-to-mid-zoom options. Rapid Hit is fantastic here, Quickdraw feels really great too. Some people might be keen on One-for-All, though the mag size is a little restrictive on this to make use of it.

// Love and Death - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve)
//notes: [MW: Velocity] "Love and Death is fantastically versatile, and currently the easiest HGL to farm for, full stop. Pre-S15, this would have been the best future-proof HGL for DPS (should they ever be buffed), with the ability to stack your mag with Clown Cartridge, auto-reload, and sporting tied-highest Velocity for 150RPMs. You will [always] want Spike Grenades, at a massive 50% damage increase, then Quick/Hard Launch depending on your Handling preference. Full Court is great in theory, but inconsistent due to the accuracy at range required, so super situational. Demolitionist is great for auto-reloading mid-DPS, and Chain Reaction makes it a fantastic workhorse for general use. (tags: god-pve)|tags:god-pve

If you ever wanted to feel what it was like to be Hawkeye, having those with a low Draw Time / Reload Speed will be the closest you will ever get. Outside of those rolls, Rangefinder acts like Impulse Amplifier's little brother, and Explosive Head is always fantastic in general, but specifically for Overload Champions.

As always, Quick/Hard Launch, Spike (+30% dmg) or Blinding (utility). If you roll Auto-Loading Holster, congratulations. If not, Surplus is very good - and Quickdraw is fantastic for PvP / clutching with Blinding Grenades in GMs. Disruption Break is fantastic in PvP (if you want to be that guy), but a bit more situational for PvE.

// The Forward Path
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have PvP): "High aim assist, and good range and stability for the archetype are the main calling cards here, while range and recoil direction are the main drawbacks, but if you throw on a long zoom scope and a Counterbalance mod and give this weapon a shot I think you'll find it to be very strong. [...] All in all, this is a fantastic gun, a great kinetic companion to Summoner and Gnawing Hunger, and I expect it to be meta for as long as 600 RPM ARs reign supreme."|tags:pvp

//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good PvP): "[...] the Fool's Remedy has great hip fire and in air accuracy by default, and the lack of reliance on crits to land a fast TtK has really given me a new strategy for dealing with apes, of basically jumping and/or hip firing and spamming shots into targets as they close, and it's proving to be surprisingly effective.
